"zohran. offers. positive. change. for. working. people.

it's really that simple. how the dnc doesn't see this is beyond me? the pollution and outright corruption, the influence of wall street (private equity, billionaire) money on both parties has brought us to where we are.

do people not remember what it was like for our grandparents? our grandfathers bought homes on one salary. they both went to college on gi bills. 

one raised 5 kids, all in private school. the other raised 2, both in private school. they took vacations. could afford to stock the pantry and have money left for restaurants and travel, investments.

these were not wealthy men. just ordinary guys who received generous help from fellow humanity (i.e, the government) got lucky and excelled.

both worked careers. one job for 30ish years. a pension and ss waiting for them. 

what changed? unmitigated greed. 

wall street and the political donor class were allowed to run wild. the abyss opened in the 1980s under reagan. the rot grew under clinton and bush 43 (i.e. cheney) made it infinitely worse. 

obama succombed to wall street, as well, and abandoned his promises. trying to play civil politics with the liars and cheaters in the gop.

trump is trump. an empty vessel for literal confederate insurrectionists and traitors to the constitution. attracting the absolute worst of the worst in the billionaire milieu.

our grandparents lived under ""extreme"" left policies of the new deal. companies like levitt & sons building prefab ""levittowns"". affordable housing en masse. of course they didn't have to deal with nimbys and a pequity complex _(now outnumbering the number of mcdonald's in the us)._

i don't understand working people who vote against their own interests. people who blithely buy into the same willie horton fear mongering propaganda which conservative think tanks and their billionaire donor class masters use to divide working people with phony, contrived episodes of ""otherism"".

we even had state colleges that were almost effectively free of charge during the 40s-70s. 

we can't all be millionaires. it simply cannot be. yet someone needs to drive the bus, clean the toilet, deliver packages, wait tables, and cook our meals.

they all, we all, deserve dignity. the possibility of a comfortable retirement not dependent on chance or fluctuating markets. stability and peace of mind.

i wish conservatives would come for tours of some areas that have been abandoned by capital. the places that used to be filled with homeowners and workers are now filled with renters. see some of the realities of american poverty and how it stretches beyond generations.",2025-10-30 20:39:56+00:00,Cuomo Threatens Dem Civil War As Zohran Surges,Breaking Points

"i'm egyptian and i watched intifada live on tv and heard palestinians talk about it in their native language. so here it is for those who want to know the truth:

- under military occupation where there are more armored vehicles than soldiers, the palestinian youth started rebelling unarmed!

- this was a surprise in older generation of palestinians who were ethnically cleansed from ""un israel"" to ""un palestinian occupied territories"" of gaza & west bank. the surprise was that the new generation born under occupation decided to resist their occupier for a freedom and dignity they never saw but were told about by their families before 1948 nakba when both jews and ""gentiles"" (we call christo-muslim palestinians today) were citizens with equal rights accepting jews immigrants escaping holocaust.

- the ""intifada"" (uprising in native language) of the youth (almost entirely teenagers, with zero adults rebelling against their families too) started by defying soldiers orders, to talk their opinions clearly while looking at the bottom of the barrels of idf.

- many of those youth were killed and some arrested. that blew up into massive gatherings where they approach the armored patrols or stations of idf and atart throwing stones! then they learnt how to use slingshots. and bragged they are the palestinian david that will win over the armored israeli goliath.

- the famous pictures of children throwing stones on tanks have harmed the reputation of israel fighting the intifada's children by tanks and armored vehicles.

- the idf started shooting ineffectively first to disperse the youth, and arresting them. this didn't work. the more they killed the unarmed children, the more the intifada inflamed.

- idf then escalated to 'breaking arms' of all youth they can lie their eyes on!! films of the several techniques they used to break the arms were all over the internet.

- before it ended by the palestinian adults, fearing the rise of killed children, the ""intifada"" has been a symbol of the cowardice of idf and how palestinian have dealt with the generational gap and didn't let their kids fall in trap of slavery and forget freedom of independence that has escaped them for a generation.

israelis must have vendetta against palestinian children since then. the killing of unarmed children by tanks almost revealed the brutality of the israeli genocide at the time.

i cannot believe i have to recount what all tvs have been showing around the world at the time to tell people about what is intifada. only when it came again in context of zohran, did i learn that israelis turned into an antisemitic thing. it was never antisemitic.",2025-08-19 19:32:00+00:00,ADL Straight UP LIES About Zohran Jewish Voters,Breaking Points

"it's unbelievable how most people simply ignore how obscene the current levels of economic inequality are, so much so that people -- in new york, of all places!  -- are being led to consider voting for a muslim candidate for mayor.  for a dude who is allegedly a ""socialist extremist"", simply because he ""dared"" to promise ""to help workers pay their rent.""  it's amazing how this goes unnoticed by all the commentators!

the guy is running on a platform of ""i'll help you with rent,"" and that's now considered socialist extremism?!  this how fucked up we are! 

he's not even promising something like ""vote for me and you'll own a piece of new york;  you'll get your own apartment in manhattan""... no, nothing like that.  

what he's promising is so little (help with rent), so mild, that it's absurd people are labeling him an ""extremist."" a bunch of billionaires and their luxurious (mostly empty) condos on one side, and the rest of us, on the other side, struggling as hard as we can to pay our goddamn fucking rents! 

we are talking about on-the-eve-of-the-french-revolution levels of inequality in america, especially in new york, which are matched only by the levels of cluelessness of the super-rich (and the media and the establishment) who criticize mamdani and sneer at american workers—which, even with their day jobs and side gigs at night, still find themselves barely able to afford (not an apartment purchase, but simply) their damn rents!

these snobbish critics fail to realize that voters are crying out: ""for the love of god, politicians, i just want to be able to pay my rent with my salary and not end up homeless!""— desperately to the point that they're willing to actually elect a muslim for mayor of the city of 9/11!

if meagerly helping american workers pay their goddamn rent is considered extremism, then maybe the real extremists are the ones who think it's normal for millions to struggle while luxury condos sit empty.

"it's weird the criticism / dismissal of steve bannon by you two - he is one of the only people who's correctly diagnosed and presented a framework to understand politics, since 2015. 

to boil it down to it's most basic level, it's now the populist left, verses the populist right. 

what resonates with we the people more than anything else, is being able to correctly identify the problems, in a very clear and transparent way. in a way that concedes that even leaders on your own side of the political aisle contributed to all the problems we are looking at today.

this is why trump was so popular in 2015 and 2016, because he did exactly that. he had his finger on the pulse of what actually were all the problems, and he didn't have a problem throwing accusations at even his own side on the things they did to contribute, because it was true, and it's been a long bubbling rage building on both the left and the right for a long time....that the establishment on the left and the right is why we are here today. they continued contributing to the problems, making them worse, all while denying they were even real problems. 

this is also why bernie sanders was so popular, and why bannon has respect for him. bannon is a political strategist at heart, and he fully recognizes the value that being able to correctly identify the problems that the american people face has - he just believes that it's the populist right that has the correct remedies to those problems. 

but he fully recognizes that when it comes to connecting with the people, and getting grassroots support, being able to identify what the problem is, is 80% of the battle. and the populist left, even if their solutions are terrible and will make things worse, will be able to win elections if they stick to their populist principles, and don't get co-opted by the establishment. 

and that's where mamdani comes in - he's a populist. young people look at him and see someone who is able to articulate what the problems are very clearly. and while his solutions would only make things worse, that's not something that most people even look to with any depth - just finding someone that is able to speak to what average americans are dealing with today is going to resonate and connect with them like nothing else will. 

and that's why bannon respects people like mamdani - he's effectively capturing the populist left, by seeing the world how it is. his solutions may be terrible, bannon likely disagrees with every single one of his solutions, but bannon respects the game. if mamdani is able to do the leg work to connect with more people in new york and gain their support by speaking truth to their struggles, then he has earned the win. 

doesn't mean bannon thinks it's going to lead to some prosperous new york or other such nonsense, but this is about political strategy. and anyone that sees how the political landscape has changed drastically since 2015, to recognize that it's now about populism rather than establishment politics, bannon will have respect for that.",2025-07-14 20:34:04+00:00,"NYT BLASTED for Zohran Hit Piece Shopped By ""Race IQ"" Poster",Breaking Points

"here's the thing most analysis is missing: the establishment politicians not backing zohran and coming out against him makes zohran seem more genuine, strengthens grass roots support for him, and makes people who have tuned out from politics take a closer look. the democratic establishment is deeply unpopular for a number of reasons, so distancing yourself from them as best you can is advised. it's similar to trump's rise in the gop. people liked that he attacked the established rebublicans like jeb bush and was willing to go there on taboos like questioning the forever wars. they liked that he didn't say and do things the same way, and that the rnc at first hated him etc. 

so i hope the old guard keeps trying to throw bs at him and is late to the game as it only benefits him and keeps him in the news cycle and able to get his message out and show his political oratory chops.

believe it or not, way, way back, before regan, before citizen's united, more politicians had skills similar to zohran in their ability to bob and weave in a campaign and not just deflect, but redirect incoming attacks back at the opposition in clip worth ways. we've had to sit through decades of fat, lazy, large donor politicians and are finally getting a taste of a good politician again and you have to admit it's truly refreshing, regardless of how you feel about his policies.",2025-07-03 18:35:13+00:00,Zohran FIRES BACK After Trump ARREST THREATS,Breaking Points

"i am australian, but i must add another point about why mamdani was so successful in this primary election, which is not getting as much attention in almost all discussions (except on some more independent shows). that is the depth of anger and absolute disgust americans now have toward the democratic party. while these emotions existed long before november, the betrayal didn't boil over until after democrats forced their voters into their newest man-made federal election farce.

also, americans mustn't underestimate bernie's influence in this race. the america that now exists thanks to his work, dedication, and belief (on most occasions alone) has reopened for them over the last decade. since november, bernie has been proven right on everything he has ever said. while democratic leadership (serving and not serving) is completely missing in action and silent, bernie is standing up as an american leader and sole american statesman. 

now, thanks to the hard work, dedication, and belief of mamdani and his campaign, volunteers, and supporters, americans in new york city have been given the opportunity to elect another excellent leader to represent them as mayor. 😊

mamdani has been attacked on foreign policy issues, and bernie has been laying the groundwork for mainstreaming these issues and openly discussing them. on iran, bernie was alone (outside of three house republicans & senator rand paul, who, from memory, only did for $$ reasons) in congress when trump and congress (...every republican and democrat) destroyed the jcpoa/iran nuclear deal in his first term as president. every republican and democrat in congress coming out now to complain about trump's actions against iran all supported and voted to destroy the jcpoa and snap back all the sanctions the jcpoa removed from iran. 

before 2015, criticising israel or even mentioning palestinians was more than just a taboo & career-ending decision. however, bernie was the most potent american to mainstream criticism of israel and for standing up to its violence.

this is an aside, but as an australian, i find another part of the coverage during this race quite amusing (also pathetically terrifying): watching certain politicians, corporate media, and other ""special interest groups"" in the us try to explain and discuss rank-choice voting/preferential voting and the absolute fear on their faces and in their voices throughout their ""discussions."" the desperation to now curtail or ban it for ""unfairness"" and being ""undemocratic"" is enjoyable and terrifying in equal measure.

"in terms of why polling underestimated mamdani's turnout: i think it is because polls rely on people that are regular voters, or at least are in some voter database somewhere, but mamdani galvanized folks that had either never voted before, or were low-propensity voters for the recent past at least. i keep thinking about the south asian indian/pakistani/bengali neighborhoods of jackson heights as a case study. many folks there are likely low-propensity voters, but they, like many others, saw themselves in mamdani and came out to vote, but many of them are likely not well-captured in any polling data due to their voting history.

polls are just a mathematical way to incorporate the assumptions of a pollster. at some level, they assign numeric weights to their assumptions. this became very clear in this race.",2025-06-25 12:33:24+00:00,LIVE at NYC Mayor Election w/ Zohran Mamdani,Breaking Points

asking mamdani directly about antisemitism with brad lander sitting next to him actually seems incredibly sharp and strategic of colbert -- who has skewered cuomo. there's a difference between campaign smears -- which mamdani can't answer to directly -- and a pointed interview question which intentionally gives mamdani a platform to shut down those concerns instead of pretending the smear doesn't exist.,2025-06-24 18:06:56+00:00,Colbert Vs Zohran On 'Anti-Semitism' Before Election Day,Breaking Points
