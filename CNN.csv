"i do hope that mamdani wins. however, i am not one who buys into any socialist fantasy. i have yet to see a socialist of any kind who can lay a rightful claim to being a true radical (which i am). those who claim to represent 'working people' should acknowledge a few basic facts about work, workers, etc. i do not claim to know all the relevant facts; but i propose a few here: 1) all human beings are heterotroph beings, meaning that they cannot possibly produce the life energies that they need ---they feed on other living beings for their survival; 2) the most glorious economic activity on this planet that living beings are responsible for (with this qualification, i temporarily look away from our greatest benefactor: the sun) is photosynthesis; 3) unlike prime pollinators such as honey bees, other insects, birds, etc., human beings are animals that cannot take much credit for photosynthesis; 4) consequently, human beings should admit that all the work that they do on this planet pales miserably in comparison to the work of those species that are responsible for the current level of photosynthesis; 5) at present, much of human work ends up depleting scarce resources, and thus condemning future generations to worse poverty; 6) human beings have long been responsible for the extinction of other species. even before the advent of agriculture, our distant ancestors killed off megafauna; 7) since the widespread adoption of agriculture, human harmfulness to biodiversity increased exponentially; 8) with the so-called industrial revolution, large segments of human beings (certainly not everybody) increased their contribution to environmental destruction, pollution, and the depletion of scarce resources.
socialists of various kinds all failed to provide, or even envisage, a viable path to try to undo the cumulative harm that our species has been causing on this planet. socialists do not propose any long-term plan for rendering agriculture unnecessary, even centuries into the future. they do not even propose ways of significantly cutting down industrial output (and pollution). instead, they pat themselves on the back for being 'radical' enough to advocate for a more equitable re-distribution of the 'loot' that human beings accumulate through their work that keeps hurting other species, and even causing the extinction of some species. some of them go beyond patting themselves on the back, and drooling all over themselves. they also imagine that they are the 'kelvin zero' of radicalism; that is, you cannot possibly be more radical than them. if you claim to be be more radical than them, some of them will consider locking you up in a lunatic asylum (if they do not execute you as a traitor).
most socialists turn a blind eye to the many forms of intergenerational harm (i.e. the ways in which a generation can lay waste to and/or diminish scarce resources that could have been left aside for future generations). to them, the 'alpha' and the 'omega' of economic harm is the 'exploitation' of the workers by those who own the means of production. they certainly refuse to recognize the glaringly obvious fact that all current economic systems on the planet steal from those human beings who do not procreate, and subsidize some of those who procreate. (some procreators are abandoned to their misery, in certain economic systems.)
i wonder if any of what i wrote will make anyone pause to ponder whether free child-care does anything to help ease the destructiveness of our species on this planet.
some of us are painfully aware that each and every political party in this country, including tiny ones, is pronatalistic. some of us do compute that free child-care entails outright theft from nonprocreators (if nonprocreator is not a word that is in your lexicon, that is not my fault), as well as a possible theft from future generations. some of us also understand that rents may come down in a given town/city/megapolis, if the overall human population there steadily decreases. free child-care is not conducive to moving in that direction.
those who have enough sense to recognize the glory of photosynthesis should also recognize that trees are among the most precious workers. a realistic 'workers' paradise' should, therefore, have more trees, fewer people.
(for those who are wondering, i am a 63-year-old man who never fathered a child. i have lived in new york for more than 36 years, spending most of my earnings on rent, knowing full well that my rent kept subsidizing the procreation of my neighbors (who, like me, belong to the most destructive species on this planet). currently, i am broke and homeless. i have never been a socialist of any kind; but i dutifully work with them in various anti-war and 'progressive' movements. i currently 'carry water' for those who campaign for mamdani --but i choose not to censor myself. those who click on my 'pen name', and follow the links can see some of my video recordings and interviews posted on youtube. my radicalism owes nothing to socialists; and i am accustomed to not getting fair treatment by them.)",2025-10-30 21:07:17+00:00,Why the NYC mayoral race is front and center on a national scale,CNN

"just to offer a quick background before my comment — i’m writing this in response to the wave of racist and islamophobic remarks under candidate mamdani’s latest three-way debate video. 

so many people are warning others about his so-called “hidden islamic agenda,” as if being muslim automatically means america is doomed. 

these kinds of comments only expose how deep the ignorance still runs — and how easily people believe what they’re told without questioning the source.

it’s honestly ironic. many of these same people claim that “the media always lies” and “everything is fake news.” but somehow, when the media spreads fear about islam or muslims, suddenly it’s no longer fake — it’s absolute truth. that contradiction alone says a lot about the kind of selective thinking and deep-seated bias that facts can rarely fix.

i fully support a society free from alcohol, gambling, prostitution, usury, children born out of wedlock, elderly parents abandoned to die in nursing homes, child predators, and sex trafficking — a world where children can safely play in the streets without fear of being kidnapped. 

these are just some of the many moral and ethical improvements islam can bring to our increasingly decaying societies. of course, people are always free to stick with the current status quo if they choose.

but here’s what most people don’t realize — islam is not new to america. it’s as old as america itself. more than a hundred years before this country was even founded, 

muslims were already here, leaving behind written records, legacies, and communities of faith. historians estimate that around 40% of enslaved africans brought to the americas were muslim. despite being violently forced to abandon their faith, many still held on quietly — some were buried in their traditional islamic garments, with prayer beads in hand, and their bodies turned toward mecca.

among them were remarkable individuals like omar ibn said, who is buried in fayetteville nc, just one hour away from my home in raleigh nc. he was a west african scholar enslaved in north carolina who left behind arabic writings still preserved today.

also, abdul rahman ibrahima sori, a west african prince enslaved in mississippi who eventually regained his freedom and returned to africa.

and then nicholas said, a muslim man who served honorably in the union army during the civil war. their lives are living proof that islam has long been part of the american story — not something foreign or imported.

so whether anyone likes it or not, islam is here, and it’s been here. and it’s not coming through the exaggerated western image of muslims with swords and violence. it’s continuing the same way it has since the 1600s — through white and black americans who choose islam and leave behind other beliefs. in fact, a significant portion of american muslims today are exactly that— not arab immigrants, as so many assume.

so prepare yourself for this change, and even if it takes time, take pride in being part of something deeply transformative — a continuation of a legacy that began centuries ago on this very soil.",2025-10-17 22:04:09+00:00,NYC mayoral candidates share their approaches to Trump in first debate,CNN

"there's going to come a time when american voters are going to have to realize they are the only people who have the power over the us government, may not like that fact or that responsibility but the responsibility does in fact lie with every single voter in the country and it is their fault that they still have not taken it back and utilized it to stop not just the 21st century holocaust but the complete destruction of the american dream for the majority of americans.

the reality is there will always be a limited amount of controlled opposition in both of the 2 largest corrupt political parties and that is by design! 
it is designed to prevent any real movement for change and prevents the majority of voters from having an actual representative democracy because people have been convinced all they have to do is vote ""the right people"" into the party!!

bernie sanders, aoc, mamdani, and the entire fraud-squad along w/ msnbc  (now msnow) & cnn and their paid so-called independent media puppets are to the democratic party what trump, mtg, massie & fox and their paid so-called independent media puppets are to the republican party
- they are the people who see mass movements (of voters) demanding change, 
they co-opt those movements promising to produce those changes in order to kill the movements by abusing the large platforms purchased for them by the 2 corrupt parties controlled by a wealthy minority to trick voters back into the duopoly that will always ensure the majority of elected representative favor the wealthy minority at the expense of the people they are paid to represent!  

netanyahu was actually correct when he stated ""fighting with the sword isn't very effective"" because its the year 2025!
that is why they are now fighting wars through technology, 
yet the majority of americans are still trying and claiming the best way to save our country is to fight them on foot, protesting, boycotting and talking about hand to hand combat ""civil war"". 

americans have attempted to ""vote in the right candidates"" but the fact is the democratic party, and now the republican party, just like to put in a new face, a new race, a new religion.and now a new age and act as if american voters are too dumb to see that they would never allow anything except a small amount of controlled opposition in both corrupt political parties!
we have used  protests, strikes and boycotts for years with only minimal effect at best! look up project ""cointelpro"" and you will realize why every mass movement for change since the 1960s has faded and not created the changes it intended. 
that is why both parties want these controlled street protests to occur (like these ""fight the oligarchy tour"" & ""no kings rallies"" ""maga"" rallies ect)
because
they are terrified american voters will rediscover the fundamental truth of our constitution: 

that all power resides with ""we the people"" not with political parties, wealthy donors, or corporate interests!!
both parties are using palestinian pro-peace protests and immigration as a pretext—a tool to divide the public and consolidate power through the creation of a police state! 

the democratic party was in fact participating in this too!! that is why they were building cop cities across the country and had no issue with police cracking, the heads of college students
and even had no issue with police using a bike as a battering ram into a presidential candidate (who technically had more than enough electoral votes to win the last election) throwing her to the ground!! the us is no longer the ""home of they free"" because we have the highest incarceration rates!  the democratic party has repeatedly had the majority and never done any form of police reform! most corporate media dubbed so-called ""blue states"" are training their police modeling the idf and literally have agreements with the state of israel with budget lines that fund it! that's not training public servants they are training an occupation force and bringing them here to our city's and towns! 

anyone who claims millions of people leaving these 2 parties by changing their registration status and millions registering to vote for the 1st time as independents demanding that each & every candidate for any elected office actually earn their vote won't have 1000x's more effect than any protest or boycott is someone who either benefits from the current corruption or isnt using common sense!! 

if you were an elected representative and were notified tomorrow your by your party that  your voters (people who have been registered with your party for decades) who you thought were guaranteed votes to keep you in power had unregistered from your party and are now are registered as independents because they feel you and your party have failed to do your job as a representative of them and they now intend to vote for a person regardless of party affiliation that will actually do their job as a representative of voters wouldn't you be forced to actually start benefiting the majority of your voters or risk the loss of power?? remember the elected representative in these 2 parties are only wealthy because they have used and abused the power granted to them by voters to exempt themselves from the laws they enforce on the people they are supposed to represent (like insider trading laws)!

americans need to understand this is not a democrat vs. republican, left v. right, red v. blue thing, this is divide and conquer by design in order for 2 corrupt political parties to maintain their monopoly on power and our wealth, thing! 

did you know corporate media outlets just invented and made up the concepts of ""red"" and ""blue"" states in order to manipulate voters into voting inside the 2 parties they push propaganda for or to not vote at all, in order to con americans out of their constitutional right to vote for an elected representative who actually represents them.  these's disgusting corporate media outlets and their puppet so called independent media reporters sow dissent, anger, frustration and fear in order to convince voters to hand over their power to corrupt people who are destroying this country to enrich the already wealthy minority!
 
the constitution grants no special or extra votes to the rich!
it gives no power to political parties!
it cannot force you to surrender your voice or your vote!
the entire current political establishment, both republican and democratic, relies on us freely handing over our power every election cycle to the candidates they pre-select by either voting for them or not voting at all! 

why do you think the democratic party funded and backed their ""uncommitted movement""?

 it was purposely to divide the anti-genocide movement that was turning millions of voters against the democratic party so they had members of  their fraud-squad literally co-opt the movement in order to stop it from making any chagr by tell people to not vote instead of voting for a 3rd party!  then, bernie sanders and aoc flew around the country in their private jet, co-opting  a movement  that was demanding change! 
they have already started telling people: these next elections are the most critical elections and that everybody has to vote democrat to get donald trump out.

when, in reality, we only have donald trump because of the corruption in the democratic party and their failures to represent their voters.  the democratic party is in fact a corporation, not a democratic organization - look it up!  
every time someone claims you live in a ""red"" or ""blue"" state, they are conning you out of your constitutional right to vote for the candidate of your choosing! they are literally preventing democracy & rigging elections!  we have a ""representative democracy"" where voters elect people to represent them in government -but it only works if voters vote for people to represent them, not for people who act as if voting is a team sport in order to maintain power over a country they are draining the wealth from! 
every time someone says we have a ""2 party system"" they are pushing oligarchy down your throat in order to steal our power away because the constitution gives the power to the majority not to political parties that can be corrupted and purchased by wealthy donors and foreign interest groups!

they fear the day we as voters  realize that we can vote out every person and party failing to do their job. 

their spectacle at the border & at these ""ice sites"" is a distraction designed to prevent us from taking back our country from the wealthy minority that has monopolized power for its own enrichment. 

our power is ours to reclaim and these 2 parties and the people they enrich at the expense of their voters are desperate to divide in order to conquer our country & our people!",2025-10-14 21:38:28+00:00,The generational divide in Maine's Senate Democratic primary,CNN

"if mamdani wins, republicans and “moderate” democrats (corporatists and capitalists) will team up to ensure he fails, so across the country, they can point to new york as a “failed experiment” in democratic socialism. wealthy new yorkers don’t have to leave the city indefinitely, they just have to spend at least half the year elsewhere. if there is a dramatic drop in city revenue, that alone will be used as evidence of an economic failure regardless of what policies are implemented. i don’t know if democratic socialism can or will ever get a fair shake in america…",2025-09-30 00:07:55+00:00,Mamdani reacts to Eric Adams dropping out of NYC Mayoral race,CNN

"mamdani reminds me of prez obama - great grassroots organising, for the people, well-spoken, charismatic and ideas-driven.

found this excerpt written by mamdani’s mother, mira nair (famous filmmaker) reflecting on obama’s presidential win: 
“obama's very presence on the national stage implied equality. like all of us, he came from nowhere special. this black guy with a single mom grew up in a small two-bedroom apartment in hawaii, and used his smarts and his discipline to harvard and from there to the presidency.  he was an embodiment of what america had been promising the rest of us.

other people had done similar things, but no one in my time had articulated their struggles and their ideas so well. 

and this is where we come to the other part of it, the obsession part, if you want to call it that. i confess it is the eloquence that got me going. obama is someone who uses language to persuasive effect - who communicates large, complex ideas with enviable ease, beauty and respect for our intelligence. all one had to do was read his book, dreams from my father, or listen to his landmark speech on race, to be convinced of his talents as a wordsmith. 

beyond standing up for all the standard liberal percepts i believe in, there was the fact that this man knew and respected language. after eight years of a president who didn't read, here was the chance to elect - o happy day! - a writer. someone who understood the power of words, and saw the importance of structure, design, the well-chosen verb and noun, knew how to make sentences sing. a thinker, for god's sake! as one columnist said recently, here was someone we haven't seen in some time - a proud, out of the closet, let's say it out loud, intellectual!

so there you have it. i worked 10 hours a day for a month for someone who has never heard of me, hoped and prayed and fought and cried and read blogs and followed every tremor in the polls and made frantic phone calls to indiana and virginia - all because i wanted a writer-president.  

late on the night of november 4, barack stood on stage with michelle and the kids, looked straight at me (okay, and a few others) and said:  'thank you. this victory belongs to you.'  i nodded back, proud as all heck.” 😊",2025-09-30 22:19:38+00:00,Mamdani reacts to Eric Adams dropping out of NYC Mayoral race,CNN

"stacey abrams is still missing the point here. whoever the dnc advisors and consultants are, they're unfortunately still misguided as to what will resonate with the american public––whereas she shifted from being anti-trump to being anti-republican, what if she focused on what she is pro- doing? that's why zohran resonates with new yorkers––instead of being against something, he focused on economic policy that appeals to the public. that's also why bernie had such a groundswell movement in 2016. until the democratic establishment understands that we have to rally behind candidates that have a clear, meaningful policy platform with a track record that aligns, we will continue to make the same mistake as elections past. by refusing to run progressives, we alienate an entire subsection of the dem base––the most active, the loudest voices in the room––and assume that with top-down messaging, we'll grab the swing states cause dems will just turn out because they hate trump. this is a fallacy. wake up! obama and cuban are imploring dems to take action by being for a comprehensive platform that uphold civil rights and benefit the working and middle classes while taking our money back from the billionaires. run zohran, run aoc, even run bernie––and stop being so scared to be a progressive party. 

this idea is bolstered even further by the likes of the influencer-driven culture we're in today––if you're trying to turn out the vote, influencers like theo von or even joe rogan can be swayed by sensible policy that is for the people. yes the dnc is a giant tent and it's nearly impossible to rally everyone together, but for the love of god please champion a candidate that has an authentic, comprehensive, meaningful platform because the alternative is just going to be a milquetoast pick who positions themselves as being anti- whatever is happening right now. you're smarter than that!

"the horror! how dare a bunch of young voters — you know, the actual future of the country — choose someone like zohran mamdani to be in the running for nyc mayor?

no wonder corporate democrats, republicans, conservatives, and every last maga uncle are clutching their pearls.

why the meltdown?
well, let’s see…
he’s young (gross).
he’s muslim (panic!).

and worst of all — brace yourself — he believes workers in one of the most expensive cities in the world should be paid something closer to a living wage, like $40/hour. gasp! — not because he’s failing, but because he’s gasp actually doing his job. you know, representing the poor, the tenants, the immigrants, and the workers instead of kissing the rings of billionaires and real estate developers. how dare he try to shake up a system that’s been so kind and fair to the ultra-rich?

he’s pushing a $40 minimum wage in new york city — which, for the record, isn’t “radical,” it’s just called math. when studios cost over $3,000 a month and a sandwich is $17, maybe, just maybe, $15/hour isn’t cutting it anymore.

but of course, cue the dramatic fainting from people crying, “but what about the mom & pop stores?!” yes, small businesses matter — which is why mamdani’s plan includes actual solutions, like payroll tax relief and rent subsidies, especially since most of these shops are being crushed by greedy landlords, not their employees’ paychecks.

and then there’s the horror of… taxing the rich. i mean, the top 1% in new york are only making over $2 million a year — why on earth should they pay the same (or more) than a teacher or a delivery driver? a tiny wealth tax or capital gains tax? outrageous! next thing you know, billionaires might only have five yachts instead of six.

meanwhile, cities like san francisco raised their minimum wage and guess what? more job growth. countries in scandinavia? they tax the rich hard, and still have thriving economies with small businesses and dignity.

🧠 bottom line:
yes, $40/hour sounds bold — because it is. but bold doesn’t mean “impossible.” if it’s phased in smartly, if small businesses are supported, and if billionaires finally pay their fair share, it’s absolutely doable.

this isn’t about punishing success — it’s about making sure the people who actually make the city function can afford to live in it. but sure, go ahead and cry about socialism while the barista making your $8 coffee can’t afford rent.

"for anyone confused as to why (in part) mamdani is so terrifying to these old-guard democrats: he accrued his campaign funds through small donations rather than super pacs, a method that entails significantly less personal profit, if not none at all. if zohran sets a precedent with this method i.e. getting big money out of politics, the corporatist, fake-left democrats will no longer be able to hoard their millions by exploiting the system in the future.

"when people say zohran mamdani’s policies will scare off billionaires, they’re really just recycling a fear tactic that’s been proven wrong over and over. the truth is, billionaires aren’t fleeing nyc. in fact, the city gained 8 new billionaires in 2023 alone and still has more than any city in the world. even after the 2021 “millionaire’s tax,” wealthy new yorkers didn’t pack up and leave; personal income tax revenues actually hit record highs. why? because nyc offers what billionaires want: proximity to finance, culture, influence, and a massive talent pool. and let’s be real, if a 2% tax on income over $1 million funds free buses, affordable housing, and childcare for millions of working people, that’s not “punishing success,” it’s smart reinvestment. zohran isn’t chasing wealth away, he’s asking the ultra-rich to chip in a little more so the city that made their fortunes can actually work for everyone else.",2025-06-26 09:32:19+00:00,'Communist Lunatic': Trump rails on Mamdani amid stunning NYC Democratic primary lead,CNN
