107,"when mamdani said he would keep tisch on as police commish, the interview abruptly ended … the producers apparently said “kill it.”  mamdani said something that countered the narrative cnn/cooper were trying to portray —  that mamdani shouldn’t be taken seriously because his politics are unworkable and out of touch with reality (translation: he refuses to be beholden to the same old powerful interests, which is threatening to the status quo). very interesting. i was waiting for mamdani to make that announcement and was pretty sure he would. tisch is just too good at her job and if she stays, mamdani has a chance to foster a good partnership with her & nypd, which will be essential if he’s to have any chance of success. he waited to spill because he needed to keep his left flank intact, so to speak. smart politics. that’s good to see because if you don’t do smart politics in nyc, you’ll get eaten alive.",2025-10-31 07:27:15+00:00,A closer look: Zohran Mamdani one-on-one with Anderson Cooper,CNN,,1

171,"i do hope that mamdani wins. however, i am not one who buys into any socialist fantasy. i have yet to see a socialist of any kind who can lay a rightful claim to being a true radical (which i am). those who claim to represent 'working people' should acknowledge a few basic facts about work, workers, etc. i do not claim to know all the relevant facts; but i propose a few here: 1) all human beings are heterotroph beings, meaning that they cannot possibly produce the life energies that they need ---they feed on other living beings for their survival; 2) the most glorious economic activity on this planet that living beings are responsible for (with this qualification, i temporarily look away from our greatest benefactor: the sun) is photosynthesis; 3) unlike prime pollinators such as honey bees, other insects, birds, etc., human beings are animals that cannot take much credit for photosynthesis; 4) consequently, human beings should admit that all the work that they do on this planet pales miserably in comparison to the work of those species that are responsible for the current level of photosynthesis; 5) at present, much of human work ends up depleting scarce resources, and thus condemning future generations to worse poverty; 6) human beings have long been responsible for the extinction of other species. even before the advent of agriculture, our distant ancestors killed off megafauna; 7) since the widespread adoption of agriculture, human harmfulness to biodiversity increased exponentially; 8) with the so-called industrial revolution, large segments of human beings (certainly not everybody) increased their contribution to environmental destruction, pollution, and the depletion of scarce resources.
socialists of various kinds all failed to provide, or even envisage, a viable path to try to undo the cumulative harm that our species has been causing on this planet. socialists do not propose any long-term plan for rendering agriculture unnecessary, even centuries into the future. they do not even propose ways of significantly cutting down industrial output (and pollution). instead, they pat themselves on the back for being 'radical' enough to advocate for a more equitable re-distribution of the 'loot' that human beings accumulate through their work that keeps hurting other species, and even causing the extinction of some species. some of them go beyond patting themselves on the back, and drooling all over themselves. they also imagine that they are the 'kelvin zero' of radicalism; that is, you cannot possibly be more radical than them. if you claim to be be more radical than them, some of them will consider locking you up in a lunatic asylum (if they do not execute you as a traitor).
most socialists turn a blind eye to the many forms of intergenerational harm (i.e. the ways in which a generation can lay waste to and/or diminish scarce resources that could have been left aside for future generations). to them, the 'alpha' and the 'omega' of economic harm is the 'exploitation' of the workers by those who own the means of production. they certainly refuse to recognize the glaringly obvious fact that all current economic systems on the planet steal from those human beings who do not procreate, and subsidize some of those who procreate. (some procreators are abandoned to their misery, in certain economic systems.)
i wonder if any of what i wrote will make anyone pause to ponder whether free child-care does anything to help ease the destructiveness of our species on this planet.
some of us are painfully aware that each and every political party in this country, including tiny ones, is pronatalistic. some of us do compute that free child-care entails outright theft from nonprocreators (if nonprocreator is not a word that is in your lexicon, that is not my fault), as well as a possible theft from future generations. some of us also understand that rents may come down in a given town/city/megapolis, if the overall human population there steadily decreases. free child-care is not conducive to moving in that direction.
those who have enough sense to recognize the glory of photosynthesis should also recognize that trees are among the most precious workers. a realistic 'workers' paradise' should, therefore, have more trees, fewer people.
(for those who are wondering, i am a 63-year-old man who never fathered a child. i have lived in new york for more than 36 years, spending most of my earnings on rent, knowing full well that my rent kept subsidizing the procreation of my neighbors (who, like me, belong to the most destructive species on this planet). currently, i am broke and homeless. i have never been a socialist of any kind; but i dutifully work with them in various anti-war and 'progressive' movements. i currently 'carry water' for those who campaign for mamdani --but i choose not to censor myself. those who click on my 'pen name', and follow the links can see some of my video recordings and interviews posted on youtube. my radicalism owes nothing to socialists; and i am accustomed to not getting fair treatment by them.)",2025-10-30 21:07:17+00:00,Why the NYC mayoral race is front and center on a national scale,CNN,,0

566,"just to offer a quick background before my comment — i’m writing this in response to the wave of racist and islamophobic remarks under candidate mamdani’s latest three-way debate video. 

so many people are warning others about his so-called “hidden islamic agenda,” as if being muslim automatically means america is doomed. 

these kinds of comments only expose how deep the ignorance still runs — and how easily people believe what they’re told without questioning the source.

it’s honestly ironic. many of these same people claim that “the media always lies” and “everything is fake news.” but somehow, when the media spreads fear about islam or muslims, suddenly it’s no longer fake — it’s absolute truth. that contradiction alone says a lot about the kind of selective thinking and deep-seated bias that facts can rarely fix.

i fully support a society free from alcohol, gambling, prostitution, usury, children born out of wedlock, elderly parents abandoned to die in nursing homes, child predators, and sex trafficking — a world where children can safely play in the streets without fear of being kidnapped. 

these are just some of the many moral and ethical improvements islam can bring to our increasingly decaying societies. of course, people are always free to stick with the current status quo if they choose.

but here’s what most people don’t realize — islam is not new to america. it’s as old as america itself. more than a hundred years before this country was even founded, 

muslims were already here, leaving behind written records, legacies, and communities of faith. historians estimate that around 40% of enslaved africans brought to the americas were muslim. despite being violently forced to abandon their faith, many still held on quietly — some were buried in their traditional islamic garments, with prayer beads in hand, and their bodies turned toward mecca.

among them were remarkable individuals like omar ibn said, who is buried in fayetteville nc, just one hour away from my home in raleigh nc. he was a west african scholar enslaved in north carolina who left behind arabic writings still preserved today.

also, abdul rahman ibrahima sori, a west african prince enslaved in mississippi who eventually regained his freedom and returned to africa.

and then nicholas said, a muslim man who served honorably in the union army during the civil war. their lives are living proof that islam has long been part of the american story — not something foreign or imported.

so whether anyone likes it or not, islam is here, and it’s been here. and it’s not coming through the exaggerated western image of muslims with swords and violence. it’s continuing the same way it has since the 1600s — through white and black americans who choose islam and leave behind other beliefs. in fact, a significant portion of american muslims today are exactly that— not arab immigrants, as so many assume.

so prepare yourself for this change, and even if it takes time, take pride in being part of something deeply transformative — a continuation of a legacy that began centuries ago on this very soil.",2025-10-17 22:04:09+00:00,NYC mayoral candidates share their approaches to Trump in first debate,CNN,,0

569,"there's going to come a time when american voters are going to have to realize they are the only people who have the power over the us government, may not like that fact or that responsibility but the responsibility does in fact lie with every single voter in the country and it is their fault that they still have not taken it back and utilized it to stop not just the 21st century holocaust but the complete destruction of the american dream for the majority of americans.

the reality is there will always be a limited amount of controlled opposition in both of the 2 largest corrupt political parties and that is by design! 
it is designed to prevent any real movement for change and prevents the majority of voters from having an actual representative democracy because people have been convinced all they have to do is vote ""the right people"" into the party!!

bernie sanders, aoc, mamdani, and the entire fraud-squad along w/ msnbc  (now msnow) & cnn and their paid so-called independent media puppets are to the democratic party what trump, mtg, massie & fox and their paid so-called independent media puppets are to the republican party
- they are the people who see mass movements (of voters) demanding change, 
they co-opt those movements promising to produce those changes in order to kill the movements by abusing the large platforms purchased for them by the 2 corrupt parties controlled by a wealthy minority to trick voters back into the duopoly that will always ensure the majority of elected representative favor the wealthy minority at the expense of the people they are paid to represent!  

netanyahu was actually correct when he stated ""fighting with the sword isn't very effective"" because its the year 2025!
that is why they are now fighting wars through technology, 
yet the majority of americans are still trying and claiming the best way to save our country is to fight them on foot, protesting, boycotting and talking about hand to hand combat ""civil war"". 

americans have attempted to ""vote in the right candidates"" but the fact is the democratic party, and now the republican party, just like to put in a new face, a new race, a new religion.and now a new age and act as if american voters are too dumb to see that they would never allow anything except a small amount of controlled opposition in both corrupt political parties!
we have used  protests, strikes and boycotts for years with only minimal effect at best! look up project ""cointelpro"" and you will realize why every mass movement for change since the 1960s has faded and not created the changes it intended. 
that is why both parties want these controlled street protests to occur (like these ""fight the oligarchy tour"" & ""no kings rallies"" ""maga"" rallies ect)
because
they are terrified american voters will rediscover the fundamental truth of our constitution: 

that all power resides with ""we the people"" not with political parties, wealthy donors, or corporate interests!!
both parties are using palestinian pro-peace protests and immigration as a pretext—a tool to divide the public and consolidate power through the creation of a police state! 

the democratic party was in fact participating in this too!! that is why they were building cop cities across the country and had no issue with police cracking, the heads of college students
and even had no issue with police using a bike as a battering ram into a presidential candidate (who technically had more than enough electoral votes to win the last election) throwing her to the ground!! the us is no longer the ""home of they free"" because we have the highest incarceration rates!  the democratic party has repeatedly had the majority and never done any form of police reform! most corporate media dubbed so-called ""blue states"" are training their police modeling the idf and literally have agreements with the state of israel with budget lines that fund it! that's not training public servants they are training an occupation force and bringing them here to our city's and towns! 

anyone who claims millions of people leaving these 2 parties by changing their registration status and millions registering to vote for the 1st time as independents demanding that each & every candidate for any elected office actually earn their vote won't have 1000x's more effect than any protest or boycott is someone who either benefits from the current corruption or isnt using common sense!! 

if you were an elected representative and were notified tomorrow your by your party that  your voters (people who have been registered with your party for decades) who you thought were guaranteed votes to keep you in power had unregistered from your party and are now are registered as independents because they feel you and your party have failed to do your job as a representative of them and they now intend to vote for a person regardless of party affiliation that will actually do their job as a representative of voters wouldn't you be forced to actually start benefiting the majority of your voters or risk the loss of power?? remember the elected representative in these 2 parties are only wealthy because they have used and abused the power granted to them by voters to exempt themselves from the laws they enforce on the people they are supposed to represent (like insider trading laws)!

americans need to understand this is not a democrat vs. republican, left v. right, red v. blue thing, this is divide and conquer by design in order for 2 corrupt political parties to maintain their monopoly on power and our wealth, thing! 

did you know corporate media outlets just invented and made up the concepts of ""red"" and ""blue"" states in order to manipulate voters into voting inside the 2 parties they push propaganda for or to not vote at all, in order to con americans out of their constitutional right to vote for an elected representative who actually represents them.  these's disgusting corporate media outlets and their puppet so called independent media reporters sow dissent, anger, frustration and fear in order to convince voters to hand over their power to corrupt people who are destroying this country to enrich the already wealthy minority!
 
the constitution grants no special or extra votes to the rich!
it gives no power to political parties!
it cannot force you to surrender your voice or your vote!
the entire current political establishment, both republican and democratic, relies on us freely handing over our power every election cycle to the candidates they pre-select by either voting for them or not voting at all! 

why do you think the democratic party funded and backed their ""uncommitted movement""?

 it was purposely to divide the anti-genocide movement that was turning millions of voters against the democratic party so they had members of  their fraud-squad literally co-opt the movement in order to stop it from making any chagr by tell people to not vote instead of voting for a 3rd party!  then, bernie sanders and aoc flew around the country in their private jet, co-opting  a movement  that was demanding change! 
they have already started telling people: these next elections are the most critical elections and that everybody has to vote democrat to get donald trump out.

when, in reality, we only have donald trump because of the corruption in the democratic party and their failures to represent their voters.  the democratic party is in fact a corporation, not a democratic organization - look it up!  
every time someone claims you live in a ""red"" or ""blue"" state, they are conning you out of your constitutional right to vote for the candidate of your choosing! they are literally preventing democracy & rigging elections!  we have a ""representative democracy"" where voters elect people to represent them in government -but it only works if voters vote for people to represent them, not for people who act as if voting is a team sport in order to maintain power over a country they are draining the wealth from! 
every time someone says we have a ""2 party system"" they are pushing oligarchy down your throat in order to steal our power away because the constitution gives the power to the majority not to political parties that can be corrupted and purchased by wealthy donors and foreign interest groups!

they fear the day we as voters  realize that we can vote out every person and party failing to do their job. 

their spectacle at the border & at these ""ice sites"" is a distraction designed to prevent us from taking back our country from the wealthy minority that has monopolized power for its own enrichment. 

our power is ours to reclaim and these 2 parties and the people they enrich at the expense of their voters are desperate to divide in order to conquer our country & our people!",2025-10-14 21:38:28+00:00,The generational divide in Maine's Senate Democratic primary,CNN,,0

725,"if mamdani wins, republicans and “moderate” democrats (corporatists and capitalists) will team up to ensure he fails, so across the country, they can point to new york as a “failed experiment” in democratic socialism. wealthy new yorkers don’t have to leave the city indefinitely, they just have to spend at least half the year elsewhere. if there is a dramatic drop in city revenue, that alone will be used as evidence of an economic failure regardless of what policies are implemented. i don’t know if democratic socialism can or will ever get a fair shake in america…",2025-09-30 00:07:55+00:00,Mamdani reacts to Eric Adams dropping out of NYC Mayoral race,CNN,,0

735,"mamdani reminds me of prez obama - great grassroots organising, for the people, well-spoken, charismatic and ideas-driven.

found this excerpt written by mamdani’s mother, mira nair (famous filmmaker) reflecting on obama’s presidential win: 
“obama's very presence on the national stage implied equality. like all of us, he came from nowhere special. this black guy with a single mom grew up in a small two-bedroom apartment in hawaii, and used his smarts and his discipline to harvard and from there to the presidency.  he was an embodiment of what america had been promising the rest of us.

other people had done similar things, but no one in my time had articulated their struggles and their ideas so well. 

and this is where we come to the other part of it, the obsession part, if you want to call it that. i confess it is the eloquence that got me going. obama is someone who uses language to persuasive effect - who communicates large, complex ideas with enviable ease, beauty and respect for our intelligence. all one had to do was read his book, dreams from my father, or listen to his landmark speech on race, to be convinced of his talents as a wordsmith. 

beyond standing up for all the standard liberal percepts i believe in, there was the fact that this man knew and respected language. after eight years of a president who didn't read, here was the chance to elect - o happy day! - a writer. someone who understood the power of words, and saw the importance of structure, design, the well-chosen verb and noun, knew how to make sentences sing. a thinker, for god's sake! as one columnist said recently, here was someone we haven't seen in some time - a proud, out of the closet, let's say it out loud, intellectual!

so there you have it. i worked 10 hours a day for a month for someone who has never heard of me, hoped and prayed and fought and cried and read blogs and followed every tremor in the polls and made frantic phone calls to indiana and virginia - all because i wanted a writer-president.  

late on the night of november 4, barack stood on stage with michelle and the kids, looked straight at me (okay, and a few others) and said:  'thank you. this victory belongs to you.'  i nodded back, proud as all heck.” 😊",2025-09-30 22:19:38+00:00,Mamdani reacts to Eric Adams dropping out of NYC Mayoral race,CNN,,1

this idea is bolstered even further by the likes of the influencer-driven culture we're in today––if you're trying to turn out the vote, influencers like theo von or even joe rogan can be swayed by sensible policy that is for the people. yes the dnc is a giant tent and it's nearly impossible to rally everyone together, but for the love of god please champion a candidate that has an authentic, comprehensive, meaningful platform because the alternative is just going to be a milquetoast pick who positions themselves as being anti- whatever is happening right now. you're smarter than that!

1316,"the horror! how dare a bunch of young voters — you know, the actual future of the country — choose someone like zohran mamdani to be in the running for nyc mayor?

no wonder corporate democrats, republicans, conservatives, and every last maga uncle are clutching their pearls.

why the meltdown?
well, let’s see…
he’s young (gross).
he’s muslim (panic!).

and worst of all — brace yourself — he believes workers in one of the most expensive cities in the world should be paid something closer to a living wage, like $40/hour. gasp! — not because he’s failing, but because he’s gasp actually doing his job. you know, representing the poor, the tenants, the immigrants, and the workers instead of kissing the rings of billionaires and real estate developers. how dare he try to shake up a system that’s been so kind and fair to the ultra-rich?

he’s pushing a $40 minimum wage in new york city — which, for the record, isn’t “radical,” it’s just called math. when studios cost over $3,000 a month and a sandwich is $17, maybe, just maybe, $15/hour isn’t cutting it anymore.

but of course, cue the dramatic fainting from people crying, “but what about the mom & pop stores?!” yes, small businesses matter — which is why mamdani’s plan includes actual solutions, like payroll tax relief and rent subsidies, especially since most of these shops are being crushed by greedy landlords, not their employees’ paychecks.

and then there’s the horror of… taxing the rich. i mean, the top 1% in new york are only making over $2 million a year — why on earth should they pay the same (or more) than a teacher or a delivery driver? a tiny wealth tax or capital gains tax? outrageous! next thing you know, billionaires might only have five yachts instead of six.

meanwhile, cities like san francisco raised their minimum wage and guess what? more job growth. countries in scandinavia? they tax the rich hard, and still have thriving economies with small businesses and dignity.

🧠 bottom line:
yes, $40/hour sounds bold — because it is. but bold doesn’t mean “impossible.” if it’s phased in smartly, if small businesses are supported, and if billionaires finally pay their fair share, it’s absolutely doable.

this isn’t about punishing success — it’s about making sure the people who actually make the city function can afford to live in it. but sure, go ahead and cry about socialism while the barista making your $8 coffee can’t afford rent.

1779,"there is no reason the house can't be in session still working. the senate is, and they have passed a couple non-budget bills that can't be implemented until the house also passes them and trump signs them. 

johnson is right about one thing: they need the democrats. so why did house republicans pass the cr without talking to democrats while knowing full well that there would not be 60 votes in the senate.

 multiple votes in the senate has been pure theater. republicans are banking on americans to just believe the rhetoric rather than remembering basic civics or government classes. 

it is baloney that democrats voted for the budget bills. it is true republicans left democrats totally out of drafting those bills then, in some cases, johnson needed democratic votes to pass those bills. this time, democrats told johnson and thune they would not vote for anything else they were left out of.

so let's look at what is really happening. what we learned in civics class. maybe johnson skipped civics - or maybe he is just hoping the american people did. 

normally, a bill is drafted by both parties. the republicans have stated publicly they want to do bills completely without democrats. democrats represent half the country, so by leaving democrats out, republicans are leaving out half the citizens. 

once the cr reached the senate and did not pass, normally it would be opened to amendment or a senate version. why wasn't it? 

the answer is simple: the democrats would have the opportunity to offer an amendment that republicans would have to vote on. please note: republicans aren't being allowed to make amendments either. why not? 

even if the senate passes an amended or senate version, it has to pass the house, and mike johnson adjourned the house. 

thune is making much of the pay and partial funding bills democrats won't vote for. that is also theater. in the case of pay, democrats have a bill to pay all military and government workers. thune won't let them bring it to the floor for a vote. why not? 

even if those bills passed the senate, they would have to pass the house, and they can't because mike johnson adjourned the house. 

this was all set up to force the cr for bills that were prepared without democratic input. 

don't forget the big beautiful bill passed using reconciliation, which requires only a simple majority, not 60 votes. johnson was just plain lying about that. 

the shutdown was caused by forcing democrats to vote for a cr where they had no input. it is a clean cr for other bills where democrats had no input. 

thune won't allow amendments - which he should be allowing. why not? because it would force republicans to vote on them, and thune knows darn well that some republicans have seen the same problems the democrats have. 

mike johnson adjourned the house so if the senate amended the house bill or drafted a senate version, it would have nowhere to go. 

republicans in both chambers were already talking about stand-alone bills to reverse some parts of the bbb. both johnson and thune know those amendments might pass, and they won't allow it. 

this is all a pr show. please don't fall for it. congressional procedures allow for a compromise to end the shutdown. republican leadership won't allow it. 

btw - apparently johnson and many other republicans do not know that communism and socialism are a form of economy, not government. i guess they assume most americans don't know that either. 

they also assume that a democratic socialist believes in socialism. not so! democratic socialists believe in capitalism, but they think a government should offer social programs, most of which we already have. public schools, public roads, fire, police, libraries. but also social security, medicare, medicaid, chip, snap, etc. 

i notice johnson didn't mention which social programs mamdani is proposing. 

as for mamdani being anti-semitic and pro-hamas, that is ludicrous, and it has become a dog whistle to rile up maga republicans. mamdani has publicly condemned hamas, but he has spoken against the slaughter of civilians and denial of aid in gaza.that is pro-life, not pro-hamas. 

but then, johnson has said the 7,000,000,000 no kings protesters are all pro-hamas and far-left socialists/communists, too. yep, a full 2% of american men, women, and children are far-left, pro-hamas terrorists.

2926,"the democratic socialist of america strategy involves:
 * running candidates in democratic primaries: this is how zohran mamdani won his assembly seat and how he is running for mayor. they aim to replace more moderate or centrist democrats with candidates who align with dsa's socialist principles.
 * influencing the party platform: by electing more members and building power, they seek to push the democratic party to adopt more progressive and socialist policies (e.g., medicare for all, green new deal, public ownership of certain services).
 * building an independent electoral infrastructure: while they largely run as democrats, some within dsa also discuss the long-term goal of building independent political power, including their own voter lists, fundraising, and candidate schools. this is sometimes referred to as a ""dirty break"" strategy – working within the democratic party for now but with an eye towards potential independence in the future, if it becomes necessary or viable.
 * ""co-governance"": as mentioned before, they aim to work with elected officials to pass legislation that aligns with their goals, pushing for reforms from within the system.
key difference: they are not advocating for an armed revolution or the dismantling of the democratic electoral system. they are participating in it to transform it from within, or to leverage it to gain power for their agenda.
so, while they absolutely want to see a significant shift in the democratic party's power structure and policy agenda – essentially, for the party to become much more aligned with democratic socialist principles – calling it an ""overthrow"" in the revolutionary sense is misleading and inaccurately equates their methods with those of fidel castro. it's a strategic internal struggle and an electoral movement, not a violent revolution.",2025-08-03 18:04:21+00:00,'Socialist is running the table': Former Bernie advisor sounds alarm on Mamdani,Fox News,1404.0,1

2983,"the democratic socialist of america strategy involves:
 * running candidates in democratic primaries: this is how zohran mamdani won his assembly seat and how he is running for mayor. they aim to replace more moderate or centrist democrats with candidates who align with dsa's socialist principles.
 * influencing the party platform: by electing more members and building power, they seek to push the democratic party to adopt more progressive and socialist policies (e.g., medicare for all, green new deal, public ownership of certain services).
 * building an independent electoral infrastructure: while they largely run as democrats, some within dsa also discuss the long-term goal of building independent political power, including their own voter lists, fundraising, and candidate schools. this is sometimes referred to as a ""dirty break"" strategy – working within the democratic party for now but with an eye towards potential independence in the future, if it becomes necessary or viable.
 * ""co-governance"": as mentioned before, they aim to work with elected officials to pass legislation that aligns with their goals, pushing for reforms from within the system.
key difference: they are not advocating for an armed revolution or the dismantling of the democratic electoral system. they are participating in it to transform it from within, or to leverage it to gain power for their agenda.
so, while they absolutely want to see a significant shift in the democratic party's power structure and policy agenda – essentially, for the party to become much more aligned with democratic socialist principles – calling it an ""overthrow"" in the revolutionary sense is misleading and inaccurately equates their methods with those of fidel castro. it's a strategic internal struggle and an electoral movement, not a violent revolution.",2025-07-31 17:26:55+00:00,Mamdani holds presser after NYC shooting,Fox News,1461.0,1

price is not as important as reliability and quality when it comes to supply chains in agriculture. american agricultural goods used to be good quality and the supply chains were secure from arbitrary changes and corruption.  now there is chaos and cheating, repeated failures of documentation and quality control, and delivery failures aplenty. but an italian pasta manufacturer or a large-scale french bakery can get high quality canadian wheat where every stage is monitored, every protein ratio tabulated, and every supply link operating smoothly. insurers know this, and adjust their rates appropriately.  all these factors outweigh the slightly lower price of american wheat, and the french and italians know that canada will not threaten them or pull the rug out from under them.  in both europe and asia, major large-scale purchases of grains and meats that used to automatically go to u.s. farmers are now going to canada and australia instead. right now, american farmers who have nobody to pick their crops are burning them rather than pay storage fees for crops they can't sell, and they are not planting for the next season.  most expect to go bankrupt or sell out.  meanwhile, farmers in saskatchewan have never had it better.  both canada and australia have put their shoulders to the wheel to upgrade quality and service to match the most demanding standards in the world market. agricultural exports are booming in both these countries. they aren't trying to bully and threaten their customers, but to please them. but donald trump, a sleazy little gangster with a lifetime of failed business ventures, cannot understand that concept.  he thinks he can just threaten people like his old cosa nostra pals in new york, and foreign countries will all panic and offer him bribes. it just ain't so.",2025-07-03 00:02:22+00:00,"Peter Doocy: Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' clears MAJOR hurdle",Fox News,2283.0,0

4110,"zohran mamdani’s primary win for new york city mayor is a flashing red light for anyone paying attention. from the perspective of many americans, this isn’t just another political shake-up—it’s a full-blown warning sign of how far left the urban political machine is drifting. mamdani isn’t just a democrat; he’s a democratic socialist who openly champions policies that would kneecap law enforcement, expand government control, and push radical ideological agendas that don’t reflect the values of hardworking citizens.

under this kind of leadership, you can expect more chaos, less accountability, and a city that prioritizes activism over actual safety and prosperity. new yorkers are already dealing with rising crime, a housing crisis, and overburdened city services. add mamdani’s defund-the-police philosophy and anti-business mindset into the mix, and it’s not hard to imagine nyc spiraling even further into dysfunction. the so-called “progressive future” sounds more like a recipe for decline—one we’ve seen before in other major cities that embraced this direction.

what’s really at stake here isn’t just nyc’s future—it’s a snapshot of where some political leaders want to take the whole country. that’s why elections matter. this moment should fire up citizens across the map to stay engaged, speak out, and vote in every local, state, and national race. because if this is the vision of progress, it’s time to hit the brakes and bring back common sense leadership that actually puts citizens, safety, and the constitution first.

4112,"new york city is headed for disaster. and these are just a few reasons why.

mamdani’s free transit plan would wipe out the mta’s $3 billion in yearly fares, leaving taxpayers to cover it through sky-high taxes or service cuts that’d make commutes hell. government bloat, think city hall’s 20% admin cost overrun on projects could easily triple the price tag of his giveaways, draining wallets fast. his tax-the-rich scheme might sound clever, but it risks chasing out the 1% who pay 40% of city taxes, gutting revenue further. i’ll say it: new york could face a fiscal trainwreck with empty offices and worse streets.

4156,"zohran. offers. positive. change. for. working. people.

it's really that simple. how the dnc doesn't see this is beyond me? the pollution and outright corruption, the influence of wall street (private equity, billionaire) money on both parties has brought us to where we are.

do people not remember what it was like for our grandparents? our grandfathers bought homes on one salary. they both went to college on gi bills. 

one raised 5 kids, all in private school. the other raised 2, both in private school. they took vacations. could afford to stock the pantry and have money left for restaurants and travel, investments.

these were not wealthy men. just ordinary guys who received generous help from fellow humanity (i.e, the government) got lucky and excelled.

both worked careers. one job for 30ish years. a pension and ss waiting for them. 

what changed? unmitigated greed. 

wall street and the political donor class were allowed to run wild. the abyss opened in the 1980s under reagan. the rot grew under clinton and bush 43 (i.e. cheney) made it infinitely worse. 

obama succombed to wall street, as well, and abandoned his promises. trying to play civil politics with the liars and cheaters in the gop.

trump is trump. an empty vessel for literal confederate insurrectionists and traitors to the constitution. attracting the absolute worst of the worst in the billionaire milieu.

our grandparents lived under ""extreme"" left policies of the new deal. companies like levitt & sons building prefab ""levittowns"". affordable housing en masse. of course they didn't have to deal with nimbys and a pequity complex _(now outnumbering the number of mcdonald's in the us)._

i don't understand working people who vote against their own interests. people who blithely buy into the same willie horton fear mongering propaganda which conservative think tanks and their billionaire donor class masters use to divide working people with phony, contrived episodes of ""otherism"".

we even had state colleges that were almost effectively free of charge during the 40s-70s. 

we can't all be millionaires. it simply cannot be. yet someone needs to drive the bus, clean the toilet, deliver packages, wait tables, and cook our meals.

they all, we all, deserve dignity. the possibility of a comfortable retirement not dependent on chance or fluctuating markets. stability and peace of mind.

i wish conservatives would come for tours of some areas that have been abandoned by capital. the places that used to be filled with homeowners and workers are now filled with renters. see some of the realities of american poverty and how it stretches beyond generations.",2025-10-30 20:39:56+00:00,Cuomo Threatens Dem Civil War As Zohran Surges,Breaking Points,,0

-where _write-ins_ are permissible, always write-in an anti-authoritarian person;
-where write-ins aren’t permissible, always vote uncommitted or leave the ballot blank.

this will continuously reduce the power of _all_ authoritarian parties in the party monopolies: until our task is complete. 
repeat strategy for all new authoritarian parties that emerge.",2025-09-18 19:29:57+00:00,'ChatGPT Response': UN SCOLDS Israel After Gaza Genocide Declaration,Breaking Points,,0

4440,"i'm egyptian and i watched intifada live on tv and heard palestinians talk about it in their native language. so here it is for those who want to know the truth:

- under military occupation where there are more armored vehicles than soldiers, the palestinian youth started rebelling unarmed!

- this was a surprise in older generation of palestinians who were ethnically cleansed from ""un israel"" to ""un palestinian occupied territories"" of gaza & west bank. the surprise was that the new generation born under occupation decided to resist their occupier for a freedom and dignity they never saw but were told about by their families before 1948 nakba when both jews and ""gentiles"" (we call christo-muslim palestinians today) were citizens with equal rights accepting jews immigrants escaping holocaust.

- the ""intifada"" (uprising in native language) of the youth (almost entirely teenagers, with zero adults rebelling against their families too) started by defying soldiers orders, to talk their opinions clearly while looking at the bottom of the barrels of idf.

- many of those youth were killed and some arrested. that blew up into massive gatherings where they approach the armored patrols or stations of idf and atart throwing stones! then they learnt how to use slingshots. and bragged they are the palestinian david that will win over the armored israeli goliath.

- the famous pictures of children throwing stones on tanks have harmed the reputation of israel fighting the intifada's children by tanks and armored vehicles.

- the idf started shooting ineffectively first to disperse the youth, and arresting them. this didn't work. the more they killed the unarmed children, the more the intifada inflamed.

- idf then escalated to 'breaking arms' of all youth they can lie their eyes on!! films of the several techniques they used to break the arms were all over the internet.

- before it ended by the palestinian adults, fearing the rise of killed children, the ""intifada"" has been a symbol of the cowardice of idf and how palestinian have dealt with the generational gap and didn't let their kids fall in trap of slavery and forget freedom of independence that has escaped them for a generation.

israelis must have vendetta against palestinian children since then. the killing of unarmed children by tanks almost revealed the brutality of the israeli genocide at the time.

i cannot believe i have to recount what all tvs have been showing around the world at the time to tell people about what is intifada. only when it came again in context of zohran, did i learn that israelis turned into an antisemitic thing. it was never antisemitic.",2025-08-19 19:32:00+00:00,ADL Straight UP LIES About Zohran Jewish Voters,Breaking Points,,0

(i have been a tenant lawyer since forever.)  the landlord would require you to submit your tax return every year, and at the landlord's discretion, he will hire a fancy law firm to commence an eviction action, and force the tenant to submit to discovery, searching every potential financial transaction you ever made.  9 times out of 10, the tenant cannot afford to defend themselves in a civil action, and so, would usually lose their apartment through litigation abuse.  nyc landlords have been put in check through the housing stability and tenant protection act of 2019, and now cuomo wants to give them a new tool to force their tenants out at will.  vote mamdani!",2025-08-12 18:55:11+00:00,Cuomo CRASHING OUT As New Poll Shows Zohran Dominating,Breaking Points,,0

4616,"it's unbelievable how most people simply ignore how obscene the current levels of economic inequality are, so much so that people -- in new york, of all places!  -- are being led to consider voting for a muslim candidate for mayor.  for a dude who is allegedly a ""socialist extremist"", simply because he ""dared"" to promise ""to help workers pay their rent.""  it's amazing how this goes unnoticed by all the commentators!

the guy is running on a platform of ""i'll help you with rent,"" and that's now considered socialist extremism?!  this how fucked up we are! 

he's not even promising something like ""vote for me and you'll own a piece of new york;  you'll get your own apartment in manhattan""... no, nothing like that.  

what he's promising is so little (help with rent), so mild, that it's absurd people are labeling him an ""extremist."" a bunch of billionaires and their luxurious (mostly empty) condos on one side, and the rest of us, on the other side, struggling as hard as we can to pay our goddamn fucking rents! 

we are talking about on-the-eve-of-the-french-revolution levels of inequality in america, especially in new york, which are matched only by the levels of cluelessness of the super-rich (and the media and the establishment) who criticize mamdani and sneer at american workers—which, even with their day jobs and side gigs at night, still find themselves barely able to afford (not an apartment purchase, but simply) their damn rents!

these snobbish critics fail to realize that voters are crying out: ""for the love of god, politicians, i just want to be able to pay my rent with my salary and not end up homeless!""— desperately to the point that they're willing to actually elect a muslim for mayor of the city of 9/11!

if meagerly helping american workers pay their goddamn rent is considered extremism, then maybe the real extremists are the ones who think it's normal for millions to struggle while luxury condos sit empty.

4716,"it's weird the criticism / dismissal of steve bannon by you two - he is one of the only people who's correctly diagnosed and presented a framework to understand politics, since 2015. 

to boil it down to it's most basic level, it's now the populist left, verses the populist right. 

what resonates with we the people more than anything else, is being able to correctly identify the problems, in a very clear and transparent way. in a way that concedes that even leaders on your own side of the political aisle contributed to all the problems we are looking at today.

this is why trump was so popular in 2015 and 2016, because he did exactly that. he had his finger on the pulse of what actually were all the problems, and he didn't have a problem throwing accusations at even his own side on the things they did to contribute, because it was true, and it's been a long bubbling rage building on both the left and the right for a long time....that the establishment on the left and the right is why we are here today. they continued contributing to the problems, making them worse, all while denying they were even real problems. 

this is also why bernie sanders was so popular, and why bannon has respect for him. bannon is a political strategist at heart, and he fully recognizes the value that being able to correctly identify the problems that the american people face has - he just believes that it's the populist right that has the correct remedies to those problems. 

but he fully recognizes that when it comes to connecting with the people, and getting grassroots support, being able to identify what the problem is, is 80% of the battle. and the populist left, even if their solutions are terrible and will make things worse, will be able to win elections if they stick to their populist principles, and don't get co-opted by the establishment. 

and that's where mamdani comes in - he's a populist. young people look at him and see someone who is able to articulate what the problems are very clearly. and while his solutions would only make things worse, that's not something that most people even look to with any depth - just finding someone that is able to speak to what average americans are dealing with today is going to resonate and connect with them like nothing else will. 

and that's why bannon respects people like mamdani - he's effectively capturing the populist left, by seeing the world how it is. his solutions may be terrible, bannon likely disagrees with every single one of his solutions, but bannon respects the game. if mamdani is able to do the leg work to connect with more people in new york and gain their support by speaking truth to their struggles, then he has earned the win. 

doesn't mean bannon thinks it's going to lead to some prosperous new york or other such nonsense, but this is about political strategy. and anyone that sees how the political landscape has changed drastically since 2015, to recognize that it's now about populism rather than establishment politics, bannon will have respect for that.",2025-07-14 20:34:04+00:00,"NYT BLASTED for Zohran Hit Piece Shopped By ""Race IQ"" Poster",Breaking Points,,1

4751,"here's the thing most analysis is missing: the establishment politicians not backing zohran and coming out against him makes zohran seem more genuine, strengthens grass roots support for him, and makes people who have tuned out from politics take a closer look. the democratic establishment is deeply unpopular for a number of reasons, so distancing yourself from them as best you can is advised. it's similar to trump's rise in the gop. people liked that he attacked the established rebublicans like jeb bush and was willing to go there on taboos like questioning the forever wars. they liked that he didn't say and do things the same way, and that the rnc at first hated him etc. 

so i hope the old guard keeps trying to throw bs at him and is late to the game as it only benefits him and keeps him in the news cycle and able to get his message out and show his political oratory chops.

believe it or not, way, way back, before regan, before citizen's united, more politicians had skills similar to zohran in their ability to bob and weave in a campaign and not just deflect, but redirect incoming attacks back at the opposition in clip worth ways. we've had to sit through decades of fat, lazy, large donor politicians and are finally getting a taste of a good politician again and you have to admit it's truly refreshing, regardless of how you feel about his policies.",2025-07-03 18:35:13+00:00,Zohran FIRES BACK After Trump ARREST THREATS,Breaking Points,,1

4887,"i am australian, but i must add another point about why mamdani was so successful in this primary election, which is not getting as much attention in almost all discussions (except on some more independent shows). that is the depth of anger and absolute disgust americans now have toward the democratic party. while these emotions existed long before november, the betrayal didn't boil over until after democrats forced their voters into their newest man-made federal election farce.

also, americans mustn't underestimate bernie's influence in this race. the america that now exists thanks to his work, dedication, and belief (on most occasions alone) has reopened for them over the last decade. since november, bernie has been proven right on everything he has ever said. while democratic leadership (serving and not serving) is completely missing in action and silent, bernie is standing up as an american leader and sole american statesman. 

now, thanks to the hard work, dedication, and belief of mamdani and his campaign, volunteers, and supporters, americans in new york city have been given the opportunity to elect another excellent leader to represent them as mayor. 😊

mamdani has been attacked on foreign policy issues, and bernie has been laying the groundwork for mainstreaming these issues and openly discussing them. on iran, bernie was alone (outside of three house republicans & senator rand paul, who, from memory, only did for $$ reasons) in congress when trump and congress (...every republican and democrat) destroyed the jcpoa/iran nuclear deal in his first term as president. every republican and democrat in congress coming out now to complain about trump's actions against iran all supported and voted to destroy the jcpoa and snap back all the sanctions the jcpoa removed from iran. 

before 2015, criticising israel or even mentioning palestinians was more than just a taboo & career-ending decision. however, bernie was the most potent american to mainstream criticism of israel and for standing up to its violence.

this is an aside, but as an australian, i find another part of the coverage during this race quite amusing (also pathetically terrifying): watching certain politicians, corporate media, and other ""special interest groups"" in the us try to explain and discuss rank-choice voting/preferential voting and the absolute fear on their faces and in their voices throughout their ""discussions."" the desperation to now curtail or ban it for ""unfairness"" and being ""undemocratic"" is enjoyable and terrifying in equal measure.

4901,"i know a lot of you on the left are excited about zohran but this is my take as someone who is looking at it from the outside.

i think zohran is going to be a huge let down for the left. the people who voted for him are college educated whites making over 100k. cuomo won the minority’s making under 50k. 

when your base is the bourgeoisie he will be captured by there politics because he won’t want to betray his new class.

ultimately new york will just get super woke with no real socialism.

polls are just a mathematical way to incorporate the assumptions of a pollster. at some level, they assign numeric weights to their assumptions. this became very clear in this race.",2025-06-25 12:33:24+00:00,LIVE at NYC Mayor Election w/ Zohran Mamdani,Breaking Points,,0

5099,"if cuomo wins after being ousted in such a crazy scandal, then there really is no hope left. republicans might as well win ny too after that.
